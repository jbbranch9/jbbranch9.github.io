What is Gabo?

Gabo is a chatbot. This means it is software that can carry on a
conversation. With proper training, a user can teach Gabo a very
large vocabulary. Before long, conversations with Gabo start to 
flow very naturally. If you train Gabo long enough, it may even
surprise you!

Where did Gabo get its name?

Gabo is named after the brilliant Colombian novelist and Nobel 
laureate, Gabriel García Márquez. If you haven't read his works,
go buy and read "One Hundred Years of Solitude" right now. Trust 
me. It's much better written than this README.
