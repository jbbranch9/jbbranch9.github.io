<h2>Instructions:</h2>

<p>Use your mouse cursor to guide your spaceship around the solar system <br />
    collecting energy-stars, and return to your home planet before the time runs out.<br />
    What's the catch? There is no timer!!<br /><br />
    Instead a buzzer will periodically chirp to mark the passage of time. The buzzer<br />
    gradually slows down. After a random number of chirps, it stops. If you haven't <br />
    made it back to the planet you'll lose all of your points, GAME OVER!<br /><br />
    Returning to the planet also ends the game. When this happens, you are allowed to <br />
    keep your points, but any left over time on the clock is lost.<br /><br />
    How high can you go? Will you run out of time? Will your nerves get the better <br />
    of you? You have to play to find out.<br /><br /></p>

<h2>Hints:</h2>

<p>Energy-stars that are farther from the planet are worth more points. <br />
    Collect them at your own peril!<br /><br />
    You have a few seconds to blast off from the planet. Afterwards, steer clear <br />
    until your ready to cash in and end the round.<br /><br />
    Energy-stars are shy. They won't reappear after collection until you leave the area.<br /><br />
    Press the space bar to reset the high score.</p>
