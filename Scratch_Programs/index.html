<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<p>Use your mouse cursor to guide your spaceship around the solar system <br>
    collecting energy-stars, and return to your home planet before the time runs out.<br>
    What's the catch? There is no timer!!<br><br>
    Instead a buzzer will periodically chirp to mark the passage of time. The buzzer<br>
    gradually slows down. After a random number of chirps, it stops. If you haven't <br>
    made it back to the planet you'll lose all of your points, GAME OVER!<br><br>
    Returning to the planet also ends the game. When this happens, you are allowed to <br>
    keep your points, but any left over time on the clock is lost.<br><br>
    How high can you go? Will you run out of time? Will your nerves get the better <br>
    of you? You have to play to find out.<br><br></p>

<h3>Hints:</h3>

<p>Energy-stars that are farther from the planet are worth more points. <br>
    Collect them at your own peril!<br><br>
    You have a few seconds to blast off from the planet. Afterwards, steer clear <br>
    until your ready to cash in and end the round.<br><br>
    Energy-stars are shy. They won't reappear after collection until you leave the area.<br><br>
    Press the space bar to reset the high score.</p>

<h3>Overview:</h3>

<p>Bubble Blaster is an Asteroids-style arcade game. It features a wraparound screen <br> 
    (objects can cross any edge and reappear on the opposite side) and supports both <br>
    WASD and 10-key controls.</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

<p>1) Fly around in your rocket.<br>
2) Pop bubbles.<br>
3) Collect hearts.<br>
4) Try not to blow up.</p>

<h3>Controls:</h3>

<p>W/8 - forward thrusters<br>
S/2 - rear thrusters<br>
A/4 - left<br>
D/6 - right<br>
SPACE/0 - blaster<br>
E/5 - toggle deceleration<br>
P - reset high score</p>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<p>Hearts restore shields, up to a max of 100.<br><br>

Your lasers can damage your shields, so be careful.<br><br>

Bubbles speed up over time.<br><br>

If you're going too fast, hit E or 5 to toggle deceleration and coast to a stop.<br><br>

Large bubbles sometimes send off smaller bubbles when popped. These speedy, little guys are<br>
worth extra points if popped with your laser, but they pop on their own after a short time.</p>
